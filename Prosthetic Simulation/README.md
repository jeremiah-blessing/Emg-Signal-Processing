1. Download and Install Arduino IDE https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software
2. Open Arduino_calibration_code in Arduino_Code folder and find the calibration threshold value.
3. Open Arduino_main_code  in Arduino_Code folder and set the calibration threshold value in the respective integer value.
4. Upload the code to Arduino.
5. Now change the COM port of Arduino to COM5 through Device manager. 
6. Now remove the Arduino and insert it again to restart the arduino code (This step is to make sure that the Arduino is connected in the right COM port)
7. Now open the Hand_Sim_Final.exe in the folder and you can see the simulation once you contract your muscles.
